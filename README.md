# Graph Algorithms

Solutions in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) to the problems on graph algorithms in [this FreeCodeCamp YouTube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWVWeAqZ0WU&t=4430s&pp=ygUQZ3JhcGggYWxnb3JpdGhtcw%3D%3D).

## Problems

The course begins with explaining the concept of a graph and covering basic breadth and depth-first graph traversal which lie at the heart of the solutions of the problems introduced later.

The problems are as follows:

1. [Has Path](https://structy.net/problems/has-path)
2. [Undirected Path](https://structy.net/problems/undirected-path)
3. [Connected Components Count](https://structy.net/problems/connected-components-count)
4. [Largest Component](https://structy.net/problems/largest-component)
5. [Shortest Path](https://structy.net/problems/shortest-path)
6. [Island Count](https://structy.net/problems/island-count)
7. [Minimum Island](https://structy.net/problems/minimum-island)

## TO-DO

- [ ] Add docstrings for each problem.
- [ ] Replace `println` statements for verifying function behaviour with JUnit tests.
- [ ] Add the test cases from the website to the problems to make testing more comprehensive.
